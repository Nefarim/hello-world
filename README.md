# hello-world
==============
My first repository for learning purposes.

My name is Brian, I was born and raised in Texas. I like learning different programming languages as a hobby
and I have dabbled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, C++, python, and now I am hoping to learn some Ruby and to continue
onto Ruby on Rails. To be honest, my working knowledge of each of the languages I've listed is pretty shallow although
I've definitely learned the most in C++.

I also like reading, math, science, gaming, eating, and I pretty much learn for fun (I'm a big nerd).

I dislike sleeping (sleep is for the week) and wish it wasn't essential.
